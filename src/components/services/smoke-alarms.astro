		<p>
			With almost 50 house fires a day in Australia, it is simply not worth the
			risk of ignoring fire safety. PSP perform a full review of all smoke
			detectors in your property. This includes: Changing batteries, checking
			expiry dates and ensuring the correct type, quantity and placement of
			smoke alarms in your property.
		</p>
		<p>
			PSP also conduct an artificial smoke test on all alarms so you know that
			they will actually work in a fire. Full package includes up to 2 new smoke
			alarms as required, each with a 5 year warranty and 10 year certificate.
		</p>
		<p>PSP issues a certificate of compliance on every job.</p>
