		<p>
			Our Basic Safety Check can be added to any of our services â€“ we take a
			little more of our time to check some key safety factors of your asset.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our aim is to ensure the safety of your tenants and their families. We
			check blind cords and electrical safety switches for safety in reference
			to NSW legislation and general safety issues. Any concerns or compliance
			issues will be recorded and communicated with the owners and/or managing
			agents.
		</p>
		<p>
			If required, our technicians will provide a costing to carry out any works
			necessary.
		</p>
		<p>PSP issues a certificate of compliance on every job.</p>
